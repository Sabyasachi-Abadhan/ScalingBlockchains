# ([GHOST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf)) Secure High-Rate Transaction Processing in Bitcoin

- This paper investigates the implications of having a higher transaction throughput on Bitcoinâ€™s security against attacks. 
- It shows that at high throughput, substantially weaker attackers are able to reverse payments that were considered accepted. 
- It proposes GHOST, a modification to the way Bitcoin nodes construct and reorganize the block chain.
