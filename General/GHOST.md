# ([GHOST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf)) Secure High-Rate Transaction Processing in Bitcoin

This paper investigates the implications of having a higher transaction throughput on Bitcoinâ€™s security against double 
spending attacks. It shows that at high throughput, substantially weaker attackers are able to reverse payments that were 
considered accepted by recipients. They propose GHOST, a modification to the way Bitcoin nodes construct and reorganize 
the block chain. GHOST has been adopted and a variant of it has been implemented in Ethereum.
