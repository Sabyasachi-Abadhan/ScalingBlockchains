# General Topics

This directory summarizes papers which propose general ideas towards scaling blockchains, which are neither
scalable consensus protocols nor architectures for scalable Blockchains

## Table of contents

The following papers are summarized.

1. [GHOST](https://github.com/SoujanyaPonnapalli/ScalingBlockchains/blob/master/General/GHOST.md)
: Proposes a novel way to construct and reorganize the block chain (Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree). They also shows that at high throughput rates, substantially weaker attackers are able to reverse payments that were considered accepted by the recipients.

Next up: [Inclusive Blockchains](https://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/paper_101.pdf)
